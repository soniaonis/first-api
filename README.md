# Spring Boot REST API with MySQL

**Project Goal:** Create a REST API using the Spring Boot framework and a MySQL database. The API will allow performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a specific resource as a user and will provide an interface to interact with the database.

## Project Context

- **Objective:** Develop a REST API with MySQL and Java using Spring Boot.
- **Technologies and Tools:**
  - Spring Boot: Used to develop the REST API for its ease of configuration and rapid web application generation.
  - MySQL: The MySQL database stores and manages application data.
  - Development IDE: IntelliJ IDEA.
  - Version Management System: Git for tracking changes in the source code.

## Performance Criteria 

The following performance criteria define the core functionality of the REST API:

- **Create:** The API should allow creating a new record in the database. This involves sending a POST request with the required data to a specific endpoint.

- **Read:** The API should retrieve information from one or more existing records. This can be achieved through GET requests to retrieve specific records or lists of records.

- **Update:** It should be possible to update information in an existing record by sending a PUT or PATCH request to the appropriate endpoint with the updated data.

- **Delete:** The API should provide the ability to delete a record from the database using a DELETE request.
- 
All these methods have been verified in Postman.

By following this project, you will gain a better understanding of how to build a RESTful API using Spring Boot and MySQL, including the implementation of CRUD operations. Feel free to use this as a starting point for your projects or to expand your knowledge of API development.
